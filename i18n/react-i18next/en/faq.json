      "question": "Why are you raising funds? \nCulture is not as important as saving lives!",
      "answer": "Culture is the essence of human existence. Culture is not just art. Culture is values. Values that guide all Ukrainians in building their own independent state. We cannot allow Ukrainian culture, as an important part of world culture, to disappear under the rubble of war, and we cannot deprive future generations of their roots. Culture is what we stand for and what we must preserve."
